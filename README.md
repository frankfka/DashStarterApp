# Dash Starter App
A minimal boilerplate for creating scalable Dash applications.

## Getting Started

### Using Cookiecutter
This repository is configured as a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) project. Which allows for variable templating.

To initialize your own starter app. First [install](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/installation.html) Cookiecutter:

```
pip install cookiecutter 
```

You can then generate the app using:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/frankfka/DashStarterApp --directory="template"
```

Note the use of `--directory` - this is because the Cookiecutter template is located in `template/`

### Direct Download

If you don't want to create the project with Cookiecutter, a pre-generated starter app is available in the `generated/` directory.
